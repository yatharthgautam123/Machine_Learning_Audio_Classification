## Introduction

This repository contains code and resources for performing audio classification using machine-learning techniques on the UrbanSound8K dataset. UrbanSound8K is a large-scale dataset for urban sound research, containing 8732 labeled sound excerpts (<=4s) of urban sounds from 10 classes.

## Features

- Preprocessing pipeline for audio data
- Implementation of various machine learning algorithms for classification
- Evaluation metrics for model performance analysis
- Visualization tools for results interpretation
- Easy-to-use Jupyter notebooks for experimentation and understanding

## Dataset

UrbanSound8K dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://urbansounddataset.weebly.com/urbansound8k.html). 


## Results

We achieved state-of-the-art performance on the UrbanSound8K dataset, with an accuracy of 80% using our proposed model architecture.
